# AI Services

This directory will host higher-level service functions that orchestrate:

- Fetching email content from MongoDB
- Calling the OpenAI client with appropriate prompts and schemas
- Persisting classification and extraction results using the email models

No business logic is implemented yet; this is a placeholder for future AI workflows.
